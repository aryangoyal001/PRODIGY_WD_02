# Task 2 - ‚è±Stopwatch Web Application
This is my **second task** for the **Prodigy InfoTech Web Development Internship**.

---

## Project Description

I created a **Stopwatch‚è± Web Application** using **HTML**,**CSS** and **JavaScript**.  
 
It allows users to start, pause, reset the stopwatch, and record lap times. The application is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, making it suitable for use on various devices.

 A stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great project to understand DOM manipulation and event handling.
 
This Stopwatch Web Application includes:

- A **‚ñ∂ icon** to start,stop/pause‚è∏and resume timer ‚è≤ 
- A **üîÅ icon** to restart and reset timer ‚è≤ 
- **üìç icon** to record and display lap times dynamically.
- A **checkbox** to show or hide Split Time
- **‚òÄÔ∏è or üåô icon** to change theme
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
